# Transform a Batch into Frames

This example walks through transforming a [`Batch`][batch] into [`Frame`][frame]s.

Effectively, this example demonstrates the _encoding_ process from an L2 batch into the
serialized bytes that are posted to the data availability layer.

## Walkthrough

The high level transformation is the following.

```
Batch -> decompressed batch data -> ChannelOut -> frames[] -> bytes[]
```

Given the [`Batch`][batch], the first step to encode the batch
using the [`Batch::encode()`][encode-batch] method. The output bytes
need to then be compressed prior to adding them to the
[`ChannelOut`][channel-out].

> [!NOTE]
>
> The [`ChannelOut`][channel-out] type also provides a method for adding
> the [`Batch`][batch] itself, handling encoding and compression, but
> this method is not available yet.

Once compressed using the [`compress_brotli`][compress-brotli] method, the
compressed bytes can be added to a newly constructed [`ChannelOut`][channel-out].
As long as the [`ChannelOut`][channel-out] has [`ready_bytes()`][ready-bytes],
[`Frame`][frame]s can be constructed using the
[`ChannelOut::output_frame()`][output-frame] method, specifying the maximum
frame size.

Once [`Frame`][frame]s are returned from the [`ChannelOut`][channel-out],
they can be [`Frame::encode`][encode-frame] into raw, serialized data
ready to be batch-submitted to the data-availability layer.
