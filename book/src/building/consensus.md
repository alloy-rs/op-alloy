# Consensus

<a href="https://crates.io/crates/op-alloy-consensus"><img src="https://img.shields.io/crates/v/op-alloy-consensus.svg" alt="op-alloy-consensus crate"></a>

The `op-alloy-consensus` crate provides an Optimism consensus interface.
It contains constants, types, and functions for implementing Optimism EL
consensus and communication. This includes an extended `OpTxEnvelope` type
with [deposit transactions][deposit], and receipts containing OP Stack
specific fields (`deposit_nonce` + `deposit_receipt_version`).

In general a type belongs in this crate if it exists in the
`alloy-consensus` crate, but was modified from the base Ethereum protocol
in the OP Stack. For consensus types that are not modified by the OP Stack,
the `alloy-consensus` types should be used instead.


## Block

[`op-alloy-consensus`][consensus] exports an Optimism block type, [`OpBlock`][op-block].

This type simply re-uses the `alloy-consensus` block type, with `OpTxEnvelope`
as the type of transactions in the block.


## Transactions

Optimism extends the Ethereum [EIP-2718][2718] transaction envelope to include a
deposit variant.

### [`OpTxEnvelope`][envelope]

The [`OpTxEnvelope`][envelope] type is based on [Alloy][alloy]'s
[`TxEnvelope`][tx-envelope] type.

Optimism modifies the `TxEnvelope` to the following.
- Legacy
- EIP-2930
- EIP-1559
- EIP-7702
- Deposit

Deposit is a custom transaction type that is either an L1 attributes
deposit transaction or a user-submitted deposit transaction. Read more
about deposit transactions in [the specs][specs].

### Transaction Types ([`OpTxType`][ty])

The [`OpTxType`][ty] enumerates the transaction types using their byte identifier,
represents as a `u8` in rust.


## Receipt Types

Just like [`op-alloy-consensus`][consensus] defines transaction types,
it also defines associated receipt types.

[`OpReceiptEnvelope`][ore] defines an [Eip-2718][2718] receipt envelope type
modified for the OP Stack. It contains the following variants - mapping
directly to the `OpTxEnvelope` variants defined above.

- Legacy
- EIP-2930
- EIP-1559
- EIP-7702
- Deposit

There is also an [`OpDepositReceipt`][odr] type, extending the alloy receipt
type with a deposit nonce and deposit receipt version.


## Hardforks

Aside from transactions and receipts, [`op-alloy-consensus`][consensus] exports
one other core primitive called [`Hardforks`][hardforks].

Hardforks provides hardfork transaction constructors - that is, it provides
methods that return upgrade transactions for each hardfork. Some of these
are the following.

- [`Hardforks::ecotone_txs()`][ecotone]
- [`Hardforks::fjord_txs()`][fjord]
