# Batches

A [Batch][batch] contains a list of transactions to be included in a specific
L2 block. Since the [Delta hardfork][delta], there are two Batch types or
variants: [`SingleBatch`][single-batch] and [`SpanBatch`][span-batch].


## Where Batches fit in the OP Stack

The [Batch][batch] is the highest-level data type in the OP Stack
derivation process that comes prior to building payload attributes.
A [Batch][batch] is constructed by taking the raw data from a
[Channel][channel], decompressing it, and decoding the [Batch][batch]
from this decompressed data.

Alternatively, when looking at the [Batch][batch] type from a batching
perspective, and not from the derivation perspective, the [Batch][batch]
type contains a list of L2 transactions and is compressed into the
[`Channel`][channel] type. In turn, the [`Channel`][channel] is split
into frames which are posted to the data availability layer through batcher
transactions.


## Contents of a `Batch`

A [`Batch`][batch] is either a [`SingleBatch`][single-batch] or a
[`SpanBatch`][span-batch], each with their own contents. Below,
these types are broken down in their respective sections.

### `SingleBatch` Type

The [`SingleBatch`][single-batch] type contains the following.
- A [`BlockHash`][block-hash] parent hash that represents the parent L2 block.
- A `u64` epoch number that identifies the [epoch][epoch] for this batch.
- A [`BlockHash`][block-hash] epoch hash.
- The timestamp for the batch as a `u64`.
- A list of EIP-2718 encoded transactions (represented as [`Bytes`][bytes]).

In order to validate the [`SingleBatch`][single-batch] once decoded,
the [`SingleBatch::check_batch`][check-batch-single] method should be used,
providing the rollup config, l1 blocks, l2 safe head, and inclusion block.

### `SpanBatch` Type



## Batch Encoding

The first byte of the decompressed channel data is the
[`BatchType`][batch-type], which identifies whether the batch is a
[`SingleBatch`][single-batch] or a [`SpanBatch`][span-batch].
From there, the respective type is decoded, and [derived][derived]
in the case of the [`SpanBatch`][span-batch].

The `Batch` encoding format for the [`SingleBatch`][single-batch] is
broken down [in the specs][specs].


## The `Batch` Type

The [`Batch`][batch] type itself only provides two useful methods.
- [`timestamp`][timestamp] returns the timestamp of the [`Batch`][batch]
- [`deocde`][decode], constructs a new [`Batch`][batch] from the provided
  raw, decompressed batch data and rollup config.

Within each [`Batch`][batch] variant, the individual types contain
more functionality.
