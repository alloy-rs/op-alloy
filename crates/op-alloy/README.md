Built on [Alloy][alloy], `op-alloy` connects applications to the OP Stack.


## Usage

To use `op-alloy`, add the crate as a dependency to a `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
op-alloy = "0.6"
```

## Development Status

`op-alloy` is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use in production.


## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is 1.81.

Unlike Alloy, op-alloy may use the latest stable release,
to benefit from the latest features.

The MSRV is not increased automatically, and will be updated
only as part of a patch (pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.

## `no_std`

op-alloy is intended to be `no_std` compatible, initially for use in [kona][kona].

The following crates support `no_std`.
Notice, provider crates do not support `no_std` compatibility.

- [`op-alloy-consensus`][op-alloy-consensus]
- [`op-alloy-genesis`][op-alloy-genesis]
- [`op-alloy-protocol`][op-alloy-protocol]
- [`op-alloy-rpc-types-engine`][op-alloy-rpc-types-engine]
- [`op-alloy-rpc-types`][op-alloy-rpc-types]

If you would like to add no_std support to a crate,
please make sure to update [scripts/check_no_std.sh][check-no-std].


## Credits

op-alloy is inspired by the work of several teams and projects, most notably [the Alloy project][alloy].

This would not be possible without the hard work from open source contributors. Thank you.
